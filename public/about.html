        <h1>About Crystal Industries</h1>
        <p>
          At Crystal Industries, we are proud producers of durable and affordable aluminum cookware, offering a wide
          range of
          cooking pots, kettles, and lids. As a trusted name under the Crystal brand, we combine precision manufacturing
          with
          quality craftsmanship, delivering products that meet the needs of both everyday homes and professional
          kitchens.
          We specialize in the production of aluminum cooking pots in a variety of gauges — from lightweight to
          extra-extra
          heavy.
          We use recyclable aluminium as one of our primary raw materials. This not only reduces environmental impact
          but also
          supports a circular economy by giving new life to valuable materials. Our products are made with care — for
          your
          kitchen and for the planet.
          Every sufuria and kettle is proudly made in Kenya — not just assembled, but fully crafted. The entire process,
          from
          melting raw aluminium to pressing and finishing, is done locally at our facility.
          Kenya remains the main market for our products, Crystal's well-known brands are well established in Ethiopia,
          Malawi,
          Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.

          <h2>Our History</h2>
          <p>
            Crystal Industries was founded in 1988 with a team of just 20 staff and a clear vision: to produce reliable
            aluminum
            sufurias that combine quality and affordability. Over the years, our commitment to excellence fueled our
            growth —
            expanding our workforce to over 100 employees and our product line to include aluminum kettles in 2018.
            Through the decades, Crystal has continued to grow while embracing change over the years, evolving with
            market
            demands
            while staying true to our values. We are proud to remain a wholly family-owned enterprise, guided by the
            same
            founding
            principles that shaped our early days. Today, second and third-generation family members lead the company
